# Mockito POC

Just a simple proof of concept to learn all the core Mockito features.

## What's this about?

Learning Mockito by actually using it. No fluff, just hands-on practice focused on the **Mockito Triangle**:

1. **Mock Creation** - Creating mocks, spies, and using annotations
2. **Stubbing** - Setting up method behaviors, return values, exceptions
3. **Verification** - Checking interactions, argument matching, call counts

Plus diving into:
- Argument matchers
- ArgumentCaptor
- Advanced stubbing techniques
- Exception handling in tests

## Goal

Get comfortable with all the main Mockito features through practical examples and experimentation.

That's it. Simple POC for learning purposes.
